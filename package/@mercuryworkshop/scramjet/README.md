Scramjet is an experimental interception based web proxy that aims to be the successor to Ultraviolet. It is designed with security, developer friendliness, and performance in mind. Scramjet strives to have a clean, organized codebase to improve maintainability. Scramjet is made to evade internet censorship and bypass arbitrary web browser restrictions.
